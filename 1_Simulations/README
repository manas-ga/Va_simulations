##  Description of scripts contained in this directory

### 00000_control_new_ac3.sh 

Bash script to run a job array using Slurm on AC3 that allows running "00_Control_sim.R " with different command line arguments listed in "000_parameter_grid.txt"

### 00000_control_eddie.sh 

Bash script to run a job array using SGE on Eddie that allows running "00_Control_sim.R " with different command line arguments listed in "000_parameter_grid.txt"


### 000_parameter_grid_ac3.txt and 000_parameter_grid_eddie.txt 

List of command line arguments to be fed to "00_Control_sim.R" using "00000_control_new_ac3.sh" or "00000_control_eddie.sh". One set of parameters per line. The parameters appear in the following order: 
Arg 1 = mu_msp
Arg 2 = r*sequence_length
Arg 3 = r_expt*sequence_length
Arg 4 = n_ind_exp
Arg 5 = n_cages
Arg 6 = ngen_expt
Arg 7 = flip_sel_coef
Arg 8 = mut_ratio
Arg 9 = total_sites
Arg 10 = use_dominance
Arg 11 = k

### 00_Control_sim.R

R script that controls and runs various scripts that perform simulations. Stores output files generated by msprime and SLiM as well as .csv files containing simulation parameters.


### 0_neutral_burnin.py 

Uses "msprime" to simulate the ancestry of the population, simulate mutations and attach selection coefficients. Generates an output in the form of a .trees file that is stored in "b_interim_files/SLiM_outputs"


### 1_History_dominance.slim 

Reads the output generated by "0_neutral_burnin.py". Forward simulates the population (for a large number of generations) to simulate its history. Samples the parents that found the experimental population(s). Stores full SLiM outputs of the population at regular intervals in "b_interim_files/SLiM_outputs". Also stores the .trees file for the population at the end of the simulation.


### 2_History_add_neutral_mut.py 

Adds neutral mutations to the tree sequences generated at the end of "1_History.slim". 


### 3_Change_sel_coef.slim 

In this SLiM script, we first read the .trees file generated after adding neutral mutations, i.e. slim_output_path + "/" + Set_ID + "_sim" + simulation + "_output_history_with_neutral.trees". We then randomly swap signs of selection coefficients *** if flip_sel_coef==T ***, and save two output files
1. a .txt file (slim_output_path + "/" + Set_ID + "_sim" + simulation + "_output_parents.txt") = This file is for downstream snalyses, it is not read by 4_Experiment.slim script
2. a .trees file (slim_output_path + "/" + Set_ID + "_sim" + simulation + "_output_history_with_neutral.trees", metadata = sel_coef)
By default the .trees file does not record changes to the selection coefficients. Therefore while saving the .trees file we also need to pass as metadata a dictionary containing the mutation ids and selection coeficients. All in just one tick. This script does not run the simulation forward. It's just a hack to read the .trees output, swap selection coefficients (if required), and then store the output as a .txt file.
The flip_sel_coef==T check happens within the script
Irrespective of whether flip_sel_coef==T, the script is run, minimally to convert the output from .trees to .txt
      

### 4_Experiment_dominance.slim 

A SLiM scri[t simulating the expeirment for 4 generations
Reads the .trees output generated by 1_History.slim
Generates a full output every generation which is stored in "b_interim_files/SLiM_outputs"


### c_Output

A directory in which the simulation parameters are stored as a .csv file

### b_Interim_files/SLiM_outputs

A directory that stores all the simulation outputs.
