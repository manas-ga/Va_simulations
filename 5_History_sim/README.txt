###  Description of scripts contained in this directory

### 00_History_sim.R ###

# This is the main controlling R script that controls the other scripts and runs analyses


### 0_neutral_burnin.py ###

# Uses "msprime" to simulates the ancestry of the population, simulate mutations and attach selection coefficients
# Generates an output in the form of a .trees file that is stored in "b_interim_files/Msprime_outputs"


### 1_History.slim ###

# Reads the output generated by "0_neutral_burnin.py"
# Forward simulates the population (for a large number of generations), to simulate its history. Samples the parents that found the experimental population(s).
# Stores full SLiM outputs of the population at regular intervals in "b_interim_files/SLiM_outputs". 
# Also stores the .trees file for the population at the end of the simulation.


### 2_Extract_mutations.py ###

# A python script that reads a SLiM output file and extracts the information on mutations stooring it as a .txt file in "b_interim_files/Mutations"


### 3_Extract_genomes.py ###

# A python script that reads a SLiM output file and extracts the information on mutations stooring it as a .txt file in "b_interim_files/Mutations"
# Also extracts the c matrix for genomes and stores it as a .csv file in "b_interim_files/C_Matrices"



### 4_Experiment.slim ###

# A SLiM scri[t simulating the expeirment for 4 generations
# Reads the .trees output generated by 1_History.slim
# Generates a full output every generation which is stored in "b_interim_files/SLiM_outputs"
