This directory contains the files necessary to generate a PDF by compiling the main manuscript (final_main.tex). 
The main manuscript refers to objects (figures, equations, etc.) defined in the supplementary information (final_supp.tex). Cross-referencing is performed using the package "xr-hyper".
This requires .aux files generated during the compilation of "final_supp.tex".

# Files and directories

Figures: A directory that contains supplementary figures that are required for compiling final_supp.tex. 

GENETICSturqoise.eps and GENETICSturqoise.pdf: Files part of the GENETICS template.

Vw.bib: Contains a library of references used in final_main.tex and final_supp.tex.

final_main.tex: A .tex file for the main text.

final_supp.tex: A .tex file for the supplementary information.

genetics.bst: Referencing style for GENETICS.

gsajnl.cls: Page layout for GENETICS

styles: A directory containing various styles used for GENETICS, of which "inv" is used for the current manuscript. 

The remaining files are generated during the compilation of final_supp.tex and main_supp.tex (see below)

# Workflow

## pdflatex final_supp.tex

This compiles the supplementary information to generate .aux files that contain labels of various equations and figures, which are to be imported into the main text.
IMPORTANT: Do not use the PDF of the supplementary information from here - it has been uploaded separately. This step is just for generating labels.

## pdflatex final_main.tex

This compiles the main text, correctly importing the labels. However, since we are using the package bibunits for referencing, citations aren't rendered correctly at this stage.
To add citations run the following twwo commands.

## bibtex bu1
## pdflatex final_main.tex
